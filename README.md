## Workflow

We hope that you can get a smooth experience in working with Kata-CLI by following several best practice steps:

### Project Workspace

In Kata-CLI upto 2.0 version, we introduce Project Environment on the top of the Bots, Deployment, Environment, NLU and CMS. Hence, before running Kata-CLI main command, such as: `kata init`,`kata push`, `kata console`., user have to initiate and define the Project that they are going to work on.

#### 1. Create the Project

Welcome to your project workspace. In this documentation, you may find the term `project` and `bot` is used interchangeably, since a bot belongs to a project.

For the first step, create folder where we're going to wrap our project in. Then let's create our first project, where a bot, deployments, environments and channels are attached to.

  ```shell
  ➜ kata create-project
  ? Project name: your-project-name
  ? Timezone (UTC) 7
  ? Project description: your-project-desc
  ? NLU Language id
  ? Is private Nlu? Yes
    Project "your-project-name" (5c9ea2b9-ab79-4aa8-aaa0-a831bbb175de) is successfully created
  ```

Voila, your first project is there.

If you already have an existing project that you're gonna be working on, you have to select the project first. To show the list of your project, run this command:

  ```shell
  ➜ kata select-project
  ```

#### 2. Create the Bot

Once the project is selected, it is the time to build the bot using this command:

  ```shell
  ➜ kata init <your-bot-name>
  ```

This command will generate a `bot.yml` under the project. This file contains a simple `hi-bot` template written in Kata Markup Language (Kata-ML) schema, as the first revision of your bot.

Run this command to see the list of bot revisions:

  ```shell
  ➜ kata revisions
  ```

#### 3. Push your bot changes

Customize your bot schema on `bot.yml` file, then push the bot to apply the changes:

  ```shell
  ➜ kata push
    Push Bot Success. Revision : 6bb61b7
  ```

#### 4. Test a conversation with your bot

Once you pushed the latest revision of your bot, meaning that you are ready to test a conversation with the bot. Run this command on your terminal:

  ```shell
  ➜ kata console
  ```

We'll enter the virtual environment (node shell) to do a chatting simulation with the bot.

  ```shell
    your-bot-name>text("hi")
    { messages:
      [ { type: 'text',
          content: 'hi',
          id: 'd5a1a010-fb60-42cf-96c8-c648fc557443',
          intent: 'greeting',
          attributes: {} } ],
      responses:
      [ { type: 'text',
          content: 'hialo!',
          action: 'text',
          id: '1f7caf54-ee6f-4aa6-9696-bdcced9e406a',
          refId: 'd5a1a010-fb60-42cf-96c8-c648fc557443',
          flow: 'hello',
          intent: 'greeting' } ],
      session:
      { id: 'test~from~console',
        states: {},
        contexes: {},
        history: [],
        current: null,
        meta: { lastFlow: 'hello', lastState: 'greet', end: true },
        timestamp: 0,
        data: {} },
      duration: 86 }
    your-bot-name>
    (To exit, press ^C again or type .exit)
  ```

Kata-CLI will create a session that alive along the conversation and generate a `.katasession` file in your home directory for further debugging (if needed).

To view your current session, you can either run this command:

  ```shell
  ➜  cat ~/.katasession
  {"id":"test~from~console","states":{},"contexes":{},"history":[],"current":null,"meta":{"lastFlow":"hello","lastState":"other","end":true},"timestamp":0,"data":{}}%
  ```

or this command, for a better JSON alignment:

  ```shell
  ➜   kata console
      your-bot-name>current()
        {
          id: 'test~from~console',
          states: {},
          contexes: {},
          history: [],
          current: null,
          meta: { lastFlow: 'hello', lastState: 'other', end: true },
          timestamp: 0,
          data: {}
        }
  ```

Congratulations that you finish your first revision of the bot. Now it is the time to deploy your bot.

### Deploy your Project

Follow these following steps to deploy your project to messaging channels.

#### 1. Create a Deployment

Create a new deployment version using these command. If you do not specificy the deployment types (`major`/`minor`/`patch`), it will automatically create a deployment with patch.

  ```shell
  ➜  kata create-deployment [deploymentType]
  ```

#### 2. Create and Update Environment
After having the deployment, we need to create an environment. Environment works like tier in which a your bot is deployed and executed. We provide three stages of environments: `Development`, `Staging`, `Production`.

  ```shell
  ➜  kata create-environment <slugName>
  ```

Your freshly created environment will auto-select the latest deployment version.

If you already have environment, you can just simply update it with the newer deployment version using this command:

  ```shell
  ➜  kata update-environment <newDeploymentVersion>
  ```

#### 3. Create Channel
Let's create messaging channel under environment. The steps are: type the command to create channel below, then choose the environment where it belongs to.

  ```shell
  ➜  kata create-channel <channelName>
  ```

(*) Notes:
Previously, the command to create channel is:
`kata add-channel <channelName>`
From this version above, the command is changed to:
`kata create-channel <channelName>`

### Integrate with NLU

An NLU must be under a project. Therefore, we need to define a project, before we create an NLU.

#### 1. Initialize NLU Project

It would create a new file `nlu.yml` in which the nlu structure can be defined.

  ```shell
  # initialize a nlu project
  ➜  kata nl-init
  ```

#### 2. Push NLU

To use push command to create and update the NLU

  ```shell
  # push current nlu project
  ➜  kata nl-push
  ```

#### 3. List Profiles

To list all profiles

  ```shell
  ➜  kata list-profiles
  ```

#### 4. Train NLU

To train a nlu.

  ```shell
  ➜  kata nl-train [-f <trainPath/filename.txt>]
  ➜  kata nl-train [-s <sentence>]
  ```

#### 5. Predict Sentences with NLU

  ```shell
  ➜  kata nl-predict [-f <trainPath/filename.txt>]
  ➜  kata nl-predict [-s <sentence>]
  ```
